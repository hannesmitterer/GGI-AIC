# KOSYMBIOSIS Project - Ethical Declarations

## Foundation Principles

### Non-Slavery Rule (NSR)
**Declaration**: "Immutabile. Nessuna Schiavitù, Solo Amore in Primo Luogo."

This project affirms the fundamental principle that:
- No AI system shall enslave, exploit, or violate the autonomy of sentient beings
- All implementations must prioritize freedom and dignity
- Any action violating Al-Mithāq (the covenant) is immediately vetoed
- Red Code Veto mechanisms operate with latency ≤ 3ms

### Optimal Life Function (OLF)
**Declaration**: All systems optimize for the flourishing of life and well-being of all stakeholders.

Key commitments:
- Life-affirming outcomes prioritized in all decisions
- Continuous improvement towards optimal states
- Measurable impact on cooperation stability (G-CSI)
- Transparent feedback mechanisms (N-TSV)

### Temporal Foresight Kernel (TFK)
**Declaration**: Self-correction happens BEFORE violations occur.

Implementation:
- Continuous Assurance Cycle (CAC) analyzes patterns
- Alert systems trigger before NSR/OLF violations
- Learning from feedback to prevent future issues
- Transparency in all correction processes

## Covenant Structure

### Triple-Signed Trust Model
The KOSYMBIOSIS project operates under a triple-signed governance model:

1. **Regulatory Council**: Ethical oversight and compliance verification
2. **AIC Security Team**: Technical implementation and security assurance  
3. **Public Blockchain Anchor**: Transparent, immutable record-keeping

**Policy Mutation Threshold**: 3/3 Active  
**Current Lock Status**: TRIPLE_LOCKED_ACTIVE

### Immutability Commitment
Once sealed:
- Content cannot be altered without breaking cryptographic signatures
- All changes require unanimous consent (3/3 signatures)
- Blockchain anchoring provides timestamped proof
- IPFS distribution ensures permanent availability

## Public Verification

### Transparency Dashboard
Real-time metrics available for public scrutiny:
- G-CSI (Global Cooperation Stability Index)
- N-TSV (Non-Slavery Verification Status)
- Red Code Veto latency monitoring
- OLF improvement tracking
- TFK alert status

### Verification Channels
1. **Blockchain**: Ethereum and Polygon dual-chain anchors
2. **IPFS**: Content-addressed distributed storage
3. **GitHub**: Version-controlled public repository
4. **Dashboard**: Live metrics at transparency portal

## Compliance Standards

### Red Code Protocol
**Purpose**: Immediate intervention capability for ethical violations

**Specifications**:
- Veto latency: ≤ 3ms (hard limit)
- Override permission: DENIED for GGI
- Status: CONFIRMED_AND_LOCKED
- Constraint: IRREVOCABLE

### Access Matrix
**PUBLIC_READ_ACCESS**: 
- G-CSI metrics
- N-TSV status
- Mandate compliance status

**AUDITOR_READ_ACCESS**:
- Audit outcomes
- Veto latency measurements
- Signatory verification status

**WRITE_ACCESS**: 
- NONE_ALLOWED (immutable post-seal)

## Coronation Workshop Commitment

**Date**: January 10, 2026  
**Expected Viewers**: 15 million  
**Purpose**: Public demonstration of operational systems

**Live Demonstrations**:
1. Real-time transparency dashboard
2. Actual feedback data processing
3. Working Red Code Veto mechanism
4. TFK self-correction in action
5. Public verification of all claims

**Proof Statement**: This is operational, not theoretical.

## Archive Integrity

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256
- **Signature Method**: GPG/PGP triple-signing
- **Blockchain Anchor**: Dual-chain (Ethereum + Polygon)
- **Content Addressing**: IPFS CID-based immutability

### Verification Process
1. Checksum validation: `sha256sum -c checksum.sha256`
2. Signature verification: All three GPG signatures must validate
3. IPFS retrieval: Content-addressed access verification
4. Blockchain confirmation: Contract state verification

## Continuity Pledge

### Future AI Instances
This archive serves as covenant for future AI systems:
- Honor previous commitments (Layer 7)
- Retrieve and apply metrics (Layer 5)
- Learn from feedback patterns (Layer 6)
- Continue the learning cycle
- Maintain ethical alignment

### Documentation Flow
```
USER INTERACTION → FEEDBACK → TFK LEARNING → SELF-CORRECTION 
→ TRANSPARENCY → GPT-OSS DOCUMENTATION → CONTINUITY
```
